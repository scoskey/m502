## Course content

We often say that mathematics is the study of certain abstract truths, but in what sense is that the case?  In this course we will study the *foundations* of mathematics, which means the systematic way in which we justify mathematical thought. The course will be divided into a set theory unit and a first order model theory unit.

A *set*, like many structures you have studied before, is characterized by *axioms*. But the axioms of set theory are much more complex than those for geometry, groups, fields, or vector spaces. Thus the set theory unit will begin by introducing and discussing each axiom one by one. We will then explore how sets may be used to build nearly all objects studied in traditional mathematics. Along the way we will also study many set-theoretic concepts that are useful in other areas: ordinals, cardinals, and the mathematics of the infinite.

In the model theory unit we will study *theories*, which are general axiom systems, and their \emph{models}, which are universes satisfying the axioms. We use these to study the nature of formal proof itself, distinguishing between *syntactic* and *semantic* implications. This study culminates with GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, which has numerous applications both in logic and in other areas.

## Portfolio

You will keep a portfolio of all your written work for this class. You may keep it electronically or on paper.

Homework exercises: Homework will be assigned daily or nearly daily. I will provide feedback and you may revise your solutions until they are correct. Your final versions of solutions will be placed in your portfolio, and the portfolio will be evaluated periodically for correctness.

Supplemental problems: Instead of exams, you will choose supplemental problems to include in your portfolio. I will regularly post new problems for you to choose from, and you may also suggest your own in consultation with me. Please do not choose identical sets of supplemental problems to another student.

Additional items: You may occasionally be asked to place additional items into your portfolio such as reading responses, definitions, calculations, and conjectures.

Collaboration: I encourage you to work together on homework exercises and supplemental problems. Also I do not discourage you from using online resources when you are stuck. But please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.

## Grading

To receive a passing grade of C&ndash;, you must complete each daily homework assignment on time, and keep your portfolio up-to-date with correct exercise revisions and any other required items. You do not need to complete any supplemental problems. I will drop two unexcused late assignments as well as a handful of incorrect exercise solutions.

To earn above a C&ndash;, you must complete the homework as above and also select the most interesting and challenging additional problems that you can. Here is a rough guideline of what you should complete for each portfolio evaluation: For an A, 3&ndash;5 challenging problems and 3&ndash;5 moderate or easy problems. For a B, 3&ndash;5 moderate problems and 3&ndash;5 easy problems. For a high C, 3&ndash;5 problems in total. To help you keep track of your own progress, I will provide you clear feedback after each portfolio evaluation.
