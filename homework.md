## Homework 1, due Tuesday, January 22

* Interpret each of the symbolic expressions as English mathematical statements.
  * $(\forall N\in\NN)(\exists n&gt;N)(\forall a,b)(n=ab\implies n=a\vee n=b)$
  * $S\subset\RR\wedge(\exists x\in S)(\forall y\in S)(y\leq x)$
* Write each of the English mathematical statements as symbolic expressions.
  * The sum of any two odd numbers is even.
  * Every real cubic polynomial has a real root.
* Recall that the ``exclusive or'' connective is written $P\oplus Q$ and is equivalent to $(P\wedge\neg Q)\vee(\neg P\wedge Q)$.
  * Write a truth table for $P\oplus Q$.
  * Draw a Venn diagram for $P\oplus Q$.
  * Is $\oplus$ associative? Prove your answer.
* Kunen, exercise I.2.1

Supplemental problems

* Write the statement more formally and prove it: "The empty set is unique."
* Find the definition of the $\cap$ operation on page 10. Give a definition of the $\cup$ and $\smallsetminus$ (set difference) operations. Then prove the De Morgan law: $x\smallsetminus(y\cup z)=(x\smallsetminus y)\cap(x\smallsetminus z)$.
* Prove by induction: if $A$ is a set with $n$ elements, then $A$ has exactly $2^n$ subsets.
* Show that Set Existence axiom follows from the other axioms.
* (2pts) Show that the Pairing axiom follows from the other axioms.
* (2pts) Show that the Separation (Comprehension) axiom follows from the other axioms.
